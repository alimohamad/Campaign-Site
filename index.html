                        <p>Since the dawn of time, mankind has sought determined leaders to guide them in their endeavors. The focused few that are capable of leading industry are those who do. Unfortunately, there are no pictures of me as an inquisitive child that I could find, but rest assured, I am one of those few.</p>
                        
                        <p>In this Club, I am ready to take control whenever control needs to be taken. I am ready to manage the affairs of the Club as its members see fit, and I am ready to meet with the administration, our advisor, or any relevant persons to make sure that the members of the club are satisfied by the way the Club is run. But most of all, I am ready to meet with the members; I am ready to heed what they think our club should accomplish by the end of the year, which direction they think the club should go in, and what our club should be. Because without them, there is no Programming Club.</p>

                        <p>People come to Programming Club to learn, which is why I want Programming Club to teach; I have devised an orgranized plan for teaching different languages/types of programming to different members by having them choose a "path" over a set period of time to study, from Web, iOS, Android, and Self-Study, where they will have a new lesson every week following the format undertaken when we were choosing officers, where a lesson would be taught every week to students. After every 2 or 3 lesson session is over, they can either rotate or continue on their path of choice. Self study would simply be the programmer using Programming Club time to work on their own code or projects, with help from some of our senior (experienced, not graduating) members, and will be allowed to experiment with the hardware I intend to buy.</p>
